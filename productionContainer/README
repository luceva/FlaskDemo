Notes:

This is a production container which runs your app in uWSGI and nginx with multiple threads.
Errors and debugging is not supported.

When in this folder with the Dockerfile, do:

docker build -t prodflask:latest .

to create the docerk image.

When ready to start the server, go back a folder so app is in the directory.

docker run -it -v `pwd`/app:/app -p 3000:80 prodflask

This will run app/main.py as the application on port 3000 on your machine.
Ctrl-C to exit.
